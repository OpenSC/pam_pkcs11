31- Mar 2005

	  already does propper null check

	  deduce it from RFC's

	This will allow coding of some tools to inspect certificates 
	without loading mapper modules

	The idea is:
		1- Get all mappers use cert_info library
		2- join all mappers in one big dynload module to 
		store all pre-defined mappers
