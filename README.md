PAM-PKCS\#11 Login Tools
========================

Description
-----------

This Linux-PAM login module allows a X.509 certificate based user login.
The certificate and its dedicated private key are thereby accessed by
means of an appropriate PKCS\#11 module. For the verification of the
users' certificates, locally stored CA certificates as well as either
online or locally accessible CRLs are used.

Detailed information about the Linux-PAM system can be found in [The
Linux-PAM System Administrators'
Guide](http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_SAG.html),
[The Linux-PAM Module Writers'
Guide](http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_MWG.html)
and [The Linux-PAM Application Developers'
Guide](http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_ADG.html)
The specification of the Cryptographic Token Interface Standard
(PKCS\#11) is available at [PKCS\#11 - Cryptographic Token Interface
Standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html).

PAM-PKCS\#11 package provides:

* A PAM module able to:
  * Use certificates to get user credentials
  * Deduce a login based on provided certificate
* Several tools:
  * Standalone cert-to-login finder tool
  * Certificate contents viewer
  * Card Event status monitor, to trigger actions on card insert/removal

You can read the online [PAM-PKCS\#11 User
Manual](http://opensc.github.io/pam_pkcs11/doc/pam_pkcs11.html) to know
how to install, configure and use this software.

### PKCS\#11 Module Requirements

The PKCS\#11 modules must fulfill the requirements given by the RSA
Asymmetric Client Signing Profile, which has been specified in the
 [PKCS\#11: Conformance Profile
Specification](http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2133) by RSA
Laboratories.

### User Matching

To map the ownership of a certificate into a user login, pam-pkcs11 uses
the concept of *mapper* that is, a list of configurable, stackable
list of dynamic modules, each one trying to do a specific cert-to-login
maping. Several mappers are provided:

* the common name of the subject matches the login name
* the unique identifier of the subject matches the login name
* the user part of an e-mail subject alternative name extension matches the login name
* the Microsoft universal principal name extension matches the login name
* etc...(see documentation on provided mappers)

Many mappers may use also a *mapfile* to translate Certificate
contents to a login name.

Download
--------

* [pam\_pkcs11-x.y.z.tar.gz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensc/files/pam_pkcs11/)

Packages for [various Linux
distributions](https://repology.org/metapackage/pam-pkcs11) are
available through the their standard package management system.

Installation
------------

Unpack the archive, configure, compile and install it:

```sh
tar xvzf pkcs11_login-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
cd pkcs11_login-X.Y.Z
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

If you want to use [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) instead of
our native URI-functions for downloading CRLs, use `./configure --with-curl`

However, up to now cURL is not able to handle binary LDAP replies and
thus CRL download might not work for all LDAP URIs.

Next, you have to create the needed openssl-hash-links.

```sh
make_hash_link.sh ${path to the directory with the CA certificates}
make_hash_link.sh ${path to the directory with the CRLs}
```

Configuration
-------------

See [PAM-PKCS\#11 User
Manual](http://opensc.github.io/pam_pkcs11/doc/pam_pkcs11.html) to
configure and set up pam\_pkcs11.

See [PAM-PKCS\#11 Mappers
API](http://opensc.github.io/pam_pkcs11/doc/mappers_api.html) to get
advanced information on mappers (mainly for developers).
